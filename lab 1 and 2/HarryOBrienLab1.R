# PART 1
# Assume variable 'Group' doesn't exist
# 1. Use all x variables as predictors to build a classification decision tree
# 2. Use all y variables as predictors to build a classification decision tree
# 3. Use all x and y as predictors to build a decision tree

# PART 2 
# What is the role of the group column (assume it is gender)
# 1. Split data file based on group
# 2. Apply what you have done in part 1 for each groups 
# 3. Get a confusion matrix for group 1 and group 2
# 4. Combine both confusion matrices to see can you get a more precise result

# For both parts you can leave the dataset as is, don't have to remove missing data
# Must experiment with different control parameters (minbucket etc.) to achieve what you believe to be the optimal tree
# Due in 2 weeks (Wed 17th Nov)
# Can upload Rscript (not marked) 
# Will need to complete a questionnaire that will be posted on blackboard asking for figures based on the results of your code (marked)
# Worth 6%
